# Project 43 Canbed Strategy
Currently, we believe the ECU provides data values as a sequential list of unlabeled values. Considering this list contains between 70 and 150 values depending on the mode, and that we are unlikely to use all of them, it would not be beneficial to attempt to parse them all into labeled data in the canbed. Instead, I recommend simply adding each value to an array, and sending the entire array over CAN, similar to the main_telemetry.ino logic. Then, using Lua scripting on the Racecapture/Track Mk3 (RCT), simply bind the desired data channel to the specific desired array index (in a similar way to the current RCT Lua script).
